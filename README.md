### You can play the game [here](https://ashotovich1990.github.io/battleship/)
***
#### The game lets a player play the old-school battleship guessing game against the computer. 
#### The computer acts no less intelligent than the human player, knowing in which direction to shoot when a ship is discovered and changing its targeting based on which ships are already destroyed.

#### I created this game in 2 days, wanting to further perfect my skills in React API and write algorithms that will make the computer play in a smart manner.
